Thought Process:

In order to create my soultion, I followed what was demonstrated in the lectue a created two sys write operations (one per quote).

Challenges:

I had a massive problem with correctly allocating space. For some reason, despite confirming multiple times that two newline declarations
and the quote were the correct lengths for each quote (121 and 86 respectively), I would print out garbage or have a letter be duplicated.
I subtracted 1 from both 121 and 86, which solved the problem and allowed for the text file to print correctly.
